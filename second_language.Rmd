Sent tweet to see what twitter #rstats hashtag could rustle up on thoughts of a language to learn, in addition to , R.

# use `twitteR`

```{r}
library(rtweet)
create_token("rtweet_second_language", 
             Sys.getenv("second_language_key"),
             Sys.getenv("second_language_secret"))
x<-search_tweets(q = '"#rstats twitter if you had the time and wanted to learn another language what language would you choose and why?"', include_rts = FALSE)
```
