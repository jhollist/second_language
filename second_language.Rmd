Sent tweet to see what twitter #rstats hashtag could rustle up on thoughts of a language to learn, in addition to , R.

# use `rtweet`

```{r}
library(rtweet)
library(dplyr)


create_token("rtweet_second_language", 
             Sys.getenv("second_language_key"),
             Sys.getenv("second_language_secret"))
original_tweet <- search_tweets(q = '"#rstats twitter if you had the time and wanted to learn another language what language would you choose and why?"', include_rts = TRUE, parse = TRUE)
recent_mentions <- search_tweets("@jhollist", n = 500, parse = TRUE) 
all_tweets <- rbind(original_tweet, recent_mentions)
save(all_tweets, file = "all_tweets.Rda")
```
